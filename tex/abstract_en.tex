This bachelor thesis deals with the implementation of a server backend Android application to support families in divorce proceedings. Implementation is carried out based on an existing design and partial implementation, which were carried out within the subjects BI-SP1 and BI-SP2 of bachelor's studies taught at FIT CTU in Prague. To achieve better results, suitable modifications were proposed according to the requirements of the frontend part of the application. The backend application is written in the Kotlin language. The Spring framework was chosen to design the REST API. The JUnit 5 frameworks and the functionality provided by the Spring framework were chosen to test the application. For security design purposes, the server uses the HTTPS and OAuth 2.0 protocols. The Swagger framework was chosen for the REST API documentation. Appropriate future steps have been proposed and will be implemented after the completion of this thesis.
