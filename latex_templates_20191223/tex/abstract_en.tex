This bachelor's thesis deals with the implementation of a server backend Android application to support families in divorce proceedings, including. The implementation is carried out on the basis of an existing proposal, which was carried out within the subjects BI-SP1\footnote{Team Software Projket 1} and BI-SP2\footnote{Team Software Projekt 2} of the bachelor's study taught at FIT CTU, which was attended by the author of this work. The application design was modified according to the requirements of the fronted part of the application to achieve better results, which is developing by a colleague - Martin Beran - in a parallel bachelor's work. The backend application, which is the subject of this work, is written in the Kotlin language. The Spring framework was chosen to design the REST API. The JUnit 5 frameworks and the functionality provided by the Spring framework were chosen to test the application. For security design purposes, the server uses the HTTPS and OAuth 2.0 protocols. The Swagger framework was chosen for the REST API documentation. Appropriate future steps have been proposed and will be implemented after the completion of this bachelor thesis.
